# Crop_Recomendation_System

Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning
This project implements a machine learning-based system for crop recommendation. The system uses various agricultural data such as weather patterns, soil types, and historical crop performance to suggest the best crops for a specific region or farm. It integrates machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict the most suitable crops, thereby improving crop yield and farming efficiency.

Features:
Data Integration: Collects data from multiple sources like weather, soil properties, and crop performance history.
Machine Learning Models: Uses supervised learning models to predict optimal crop choices.
User Input: Allows users to input region-specific data (e.g., soil quality, temperature, humidity) for personalized crop recommendations.
API Integration: The system integrates APIs to gather real-time weather and soil data, ensuring accurate and up-to-date recommendations.
User Interface: Provides an easy-to-use interface for farmers and agriculture experts to interact with the system and receive recommendations.
Technologies Used:
Machine Learning: Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
API Integration: Custom APIs for real-time data collection
Frontend: React for user interface
Backend: Flask for managing requests and serving recommendations
Objective:
The system aims to support farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection, thereby increasing efficiency, yield, and sustainability in agriculture.
